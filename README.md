# Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore beamer template

Beamer presentation template of Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore <br />
This template let you write your presentation following some standard graphical rules. 

> LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. 

You should only focus on the content of your document, its layout will be managed by LaTeX directly.

> When writing, the writer uses plain text (WYSIWYM "What you see is what you mean") as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG ("What you see is what you get") word processors like Microsoft PowerPoint.

This template is based on the [Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) beamer template:
> Metropolis is a simple, modern Beamer theme suitable for anyone to use. It tries to minimize noise and maximize space for content; the only visual flourish it offers is an (optional) progress bar added to each slide.

## Installation
Installing this template from source, like any LaTeX theme, involves three easy steps:
1. **Download the source** as a zip archive of the latest development version.
2. **Copy** the zip archive in a new folder. All the materials (images, biography) related to your thesis should be inside this folder.
3. **Open the file** `UCSC_Presentation.tex` and compile it. In order to do so, you should:
   - Donwload a full TeX distribution from the [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) website. Then donwload a TeX editor, as for example [TeXmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) or [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net).
   - or Register on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) website and use its online compiler. This second option is suggested for one-time users.
4. For best results **install** Mozilla's [Fira Sans](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-sans) on your computer and compile the document with *XeLaTeX*. On Overleaf, after having uploaded the project as a zip folder, you should click on the *menu* (left top corner) and change the compiler from *pdfLaTeX* to *XeLaTeX*.
   
If there are no errors in your code, a `UCSC_Presentation.pdf` will be printed as an output.
